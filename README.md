## ⚠️ Development Status

**This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for production use.**

Issues, bugs, and incomplete features may be present. We welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions to help improve the framework.

## 🚀 Overview

Expressify is a minimalist web framework for Python inspired by Express.js. It provides a simple and intuitive API for building web applications and APIs with minimal boilerplate.

```python
from expressify import expressify

app = expressify()

@app.get('/')
def home(req, res):
    return res.send('Hello from Expressify!')

@app.get('/api/users/:id')
def get_user(req, res):
    user_id = req.params['id']
    return res.json({'id': user_id, 'name': 'Dhruv Rawat'})

app.listen(port=3000,hostname="127.0.0.1")
```

## 🔥 Features

- **Intuitive Routing**: Define routes using decorators and HTTP method verbs
- **Middleware Support**: Process requests and responses with middleware functions
- **Request/Response Objects**: Simplify HTTP handling with powerful abstractions
- **Template Rendering**: Built-in support for Jinja2 templates
- **Static File Serving**: Easily serve CSS, JavaScript, and image files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management and custom error handlers
- **Hot Reloading**: Development server with automatic reloading

## 🔄 Development Server with Hot Reloading

Expressify comes with a development server that automatically reloads your application when files change, making development faster and more efficient.

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run your application with hot reloading
python dev.py examples/01-hello-world/app.py
```

Features of the development server:
- Detects file changes in real-time
- Automatically restarts your application
- Shows application output in the console
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
